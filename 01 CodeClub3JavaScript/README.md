## Stage 1:
Using Javascript, create a light switch button.
The button is square and says “ON” when the button is activated and “OFF” when the button is inactive.
## Stage 2:
Create a “lightbox” next to your switch. When the switch is clicked on, the light box will be yellow and when the switch is in the off switch, the light box will be
black.
## Stage 3:
As an extension, create a 2x2 grid with four buttons. Each with a different colour of your choice. Link stage one, two and three together, so that when the switch is
clicked off - the lightbox is black and when it is on, the colour of the box is assigned to the selected colour button in your button grid.

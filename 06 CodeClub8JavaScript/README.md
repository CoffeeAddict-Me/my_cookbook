# FizzBuzz
We’re going to play a game of FizzBuzz. Each question is worth the number of
points indicated by the question number.  
You can complete the questions in whatever order you like. When you’ve
completed the task, get your solution signed off by your mentor.  
The fastest team to complete each question receives an additional 5 points.  
1. Classic FizzBuzz:  
   * Write a script that prints numbers from 1 to 100.  
   * For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.  
   * For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.  
   * For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print
   "FizzBuzz."  
2. Reverse FizzBuzz:  
   * Modify the FizzBuzz script to print in reverse order, from 100
   to 1  
3. Custom FizzBuzz:
   * Allow the user to input the range of numbers (start and end)
   for the FizzBuzz game.  
4. FizzBuzz with a Twist:  
   * For multiples of 3, print "Fizz."  
   * For multiples of 5, print "Buzz."  
   * For multiples of 7, print "Bang."  
   * For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print
   "FizzBuzz."  
   * For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 7, print
   "FizzBang."  
   * For numbers which are multiples of both 5 and 7, print
   "BuzzBang."  
   * For numbers which are multiples of 3, 5, and 7, print
   "FizzBuzzBang."   
5. FizzBuzz Advanced:  
   * Modify the FizzBuzz script to handle an arbitrary number of
   rules.  
   * Each rule consists of a divisor and the corresponding word to
   print if a number is a multiple of that divisor.

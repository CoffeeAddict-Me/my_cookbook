## RPG Game

This is a mini delf playing game that I did in conjunction with Chat GPT
The game has a couple of monsters and a player
There are a couple of games in the folder

There is on in the monsters package. Run the *"Game"* Class to begin
You will also find directions.md that I got from chat GPT to progress my development

I had a different approach to the problem so I created my own solution that can be found and run in "enhanced" package.

There is also a ChatGPT suggested solution that I adopted. This can be run in the GPTSolution package

The game was never intended to be interactive. It's just a simple exercice.

Great choice! Let's dive into some Object-Oriented Programming concepts focusing on classes and objects.

#### Problem 1:
Imagine you're creating a simple game. Design a class named Monster that has two attributes: name (String) and health (int). Also, create a method named takeDamage that reduces the monster's health by a given amount. Lastly, add a method named isAlive that returns true if the monster's health is greater than 0, otherwise false.

Fantastic! Let's explore how to use the Monster class we've designed. We'll create a small scenario where you create a monster, deal some damage to it, and then check if it's still alive.

#### Scenario:

Create a Monster object named "Goblin" with 100 health.
The "Goblin" takes 30 points of damage.
Check if "Goblin" is still alive and print its status.
The "Goblin" takes another 80 points of damage.
Check again if "Goblin" is still alive and print its status.
To achieve this, you'll need to instantiate a Monster object, use the takeDamage method to apply damage, and then use the isAlive method to check the monster's status.

### GPT
Let's continue exploring Object-Oriented Programming by adding a new feature to our Monster class and creating interactions between objects. This time, we'll introduce a method that allows a monster to attack another monster.

#### Enhancement:
Add an attack method to the Monster class that allows a monster to attack another monster, reducing the target monster's health by a specified attack power.

#### Problem:

Add an attack method to the Monster class. This method should take another Monster object as a parameter and an int representing the attack power.
When a monster attacks another monster, reduce the target's health by the attack power.
Ensure you can check if the target monster is still alive after the attack.
How do you think you can implement this attack method within the Monster class?

Great! Let's expand our mini-game by introducing more object-oriented programming concepts. This time, we'll add special abilities to our monsters. Each monster will have a unique ability based on its type.

#### New Feature: Special Abilities

Create a subclass for each monster type with a special ability. For example, a Goblin might have a "steal" ability, and a Troll might have a "regenerate" ability.
The "steal" ability allows a Goblin to steal some health from another monster, adding it to its own.
The "regenerate" ability allows a Troll to regain a portion of its health.
Implementation Steps:

* Step 1: Define a Goblin class that extends Monster and includes a steal method.
* Step 2: Define a Troll class that extends Monster and includes a regenerate method.
* Step 3: Demonstrate these abilities in the Game class by creating instances of Goblin and Troll and having them use their abilities.

How do you think you can implement the subclass for Goblin with the "steal" ability?

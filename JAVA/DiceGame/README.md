There are no packages in the app as I was still learning Java and was not quite sure how to use them and group my classess
It was created to become more familiar with Classes in Java programming and was fun to create
I believe there was not a lot of error handling either. So it may be a bit fragile.

The game was never finished as the loot has no impact on the outcome, as I run out of time and moved on with the course.

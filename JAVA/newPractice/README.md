## EXERCISES

some of the exercises were taken from CodeWars while practicing Java
Some were from LinkedIn

There is a mixture of both

The folder contains solutions to the exercises and problems I solved.

### Count The Monkeys - Code Wars

Problem:  
You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there (n), but your son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1.  
As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero.  
For example(Input --> Output):  
          10 --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]  
          1 --> [1]

### Find Second Smallest - Code Wars

Problem:  
Find second-smallest integer from an array of integers.

### Head On The Wrong End - Code Wars

Problem:  
You're at the zoo... all the meerkats look weird. Something has gone terribly wrong - someone has gone and switched their heads and tails around!  
Save the animals by switching them back. You will be given an array which will have three values (tail, body, head). It is your job to re-arrange the array so that the animal is the right way round (head, body, tail).  
Same goes for all the other arrays/lists that you will get in the tests: you have to change the element positions with the same exact logics  
Simples!

### Kata Casting Strings - Code Wars

Problem:  
Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.   
Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.   
Example:  
Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"  
Jaden-Cased:     "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"  

Note that the Java version expects a return value of null for an empty string or null.

### Sum Array - Code Wars

Problem:  
Calculate sum of the array

### Kata Sum Without Highest And Lowest - Code Wars

Problem:  
Sum all the numbers of a given array ( cq. list ), except the highest and the lowest element ( by value, not by index! ).  
The highest or lowest element respectively is a single element at each edge, even if there are more than one with the same value.   
Mind the input validation.  

{ 6, 2, 1, 8, 10 } => 16  
{ 1, 1, 11, 2, 3 } => 6

### Move Zeros To The End - Code Wars

Problem:  
Move all zeros to the End of the array.

### Number Divisible By Number - Code Wars

Problem:  
Complete the function which takes two arguments and returns all numbers which are divisible by the given divisor. First argument is an array of numbers and the second is the divisor.  

Example(Input1, Input2 --> Output)  
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2 --> [2, 4, 6]  

### Power of Two - Code Wars

Problem:  
Calculate power of two.

### Reverse Array

Problem:  
Given an array reverse it.


### Rotate Array

Problem:  
Given an array rotate it.

### Print Triangle

Problem:  
Print triangle made of characters

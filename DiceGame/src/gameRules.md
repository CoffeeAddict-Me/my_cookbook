Roll the die game - You die or not! 

will have a die 

will have a some characters you can choose from, they will have different abilities

will go through a map consisting of 42 fields (because 42 is answer to everything)

each field will have different event, where you roll a die, good or bad (these will be generated randomly)

Your character will gain loot

who finishes wins
some loot can protect you from dying
some loot can affect your movement(numbers of rolls)


Oh, your character can die

let's see how far I can take it

1. create die with roll die function
2. create characters
    elf HP20 | movement 2 | bag capacity 3
    human HP 25 | movement 1| bag capacity 4
    orc HP 30 | movement 1 | bag capacity 6
    zombie HP 25 movement 2 | bag capacity 5
3. create attributes for each character
    HP - life
    speed - how many times can roll
    
4. create Loot, good and bad
5. create fields with randomly generated Loot - will need random event generator

6. create the main app

Step 1
Preheat oven to 375°. Place a baking sheet in oven. Lightly grease a 9"-x-1.5" pie dish with cooking spray.
Step 2
On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to a 12" circle. Drape over pie dish and gently press to fit, making sure there are no air bubbles. Trim overhang to 1" and tuck under itself. Crimp edges as desired. Chill in refrigerator until cold, at least 30 minutes or up to 3 hours.
Step 3
Line dough with foil or parchment and fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake crust until top and sides are dry and set, 15 to 18 minutes, then remove foil and weights. Continue to bake until the bottom is dry to the touch, about 5 minutes more. Let cool.
Step 4
Reduce oven to 350º. In a large bowl, whisk eggs, pumpkin, brown sugar, cream, pumpkin pie spice, vanilla, salt, and flour until smooth. Pour pumpkin mixture into crust. Carefully place pie dish on heated sheet.
Step 5
Bake pie until filling is slightly jiggly in the center and crust is golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes. Turn off oven, prop door open, and let pie cool 30 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cool completely.
Step 6
Serve with whipped cream (if using).

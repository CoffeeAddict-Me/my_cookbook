Your goal is to create a form with 2 fields:
* first name
* last name  

A generate button and box titled “username” that can be
populated with an outcome.  

Once both fields are completed by the user and the "Generate"
button is clicked, a username should be automatically generated
and displayed within the username box you’ve created.  

The username should be in the following format:  

[firstname]_[lastname]_[random integer]  

First name and last name should be lowercase, and then a random
integer between 1 and 9 should be added to the end.  

For example: if the inputs are "Daniel" and "SMITH" the generated
username could be "daniel_smith_4" or "daniel_smith_2".  

### Extension Task:
Create a check box alongside the input fields. The check box
should be labelled “symbol”.  

If the check box is selected, a random symbol should be
added to the end of the username.  

For example: if the inputs are "Daniel" and "SMITH" AND the check
box is selected, the generated username could be

"daniel_smith_4@" or "daniel_smith_2!".  
Symbols: ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) ? + ~
